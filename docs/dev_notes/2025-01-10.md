### New Features Implemented

#### 1. **Menu for Multiple Filtering and Reporting**
- Users can now perform multiple filter operations and generate combat reports without exiting the system.
- This enhancement improves usability and reduces the need for repetitive restarts.

#### 2. **Files with Timestamp**
- Files are now saved with the current date and time in their log filename (e.g., `resumo_danos_C_2025-01-10_15-30-01.txt`).
- This prevents overwriting previous files and makes file organization easier.

### Previous Features

- **Loop for Continuous Operation**: Implemented a loop for repeated filtering within the menu.
- **Automatic Navigation**: The system now automatically navigates to the log folder for user convenience.

### Next Steps
- Automatic creation of folders for generated files, increasing organization.
- Expand language filter support to include other languages.
- Optimize report generation for faster processing.
- Add customizable filters for specific combat scenarios or keywords.
- Eliminate the need to manually copy log files by allowing the system to navigate directly to the log folder.

### Version Update
- **Version 1.02**: Added menu navigation and timestamped log file generation.
